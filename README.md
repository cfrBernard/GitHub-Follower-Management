## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice // (01/31/2025) 

Please be aware that all versions of this tool currently have a **major issue** that affects users with several thousand followers/following. üö®

If your account has **thousands of followers or following**, **I strongly advise against using this tool at the moment**. There are known issues with pagination and the handling of large user lists, which may result in incomplete or incorrect data being processed.

üí° **I am actively working on fixing this issue**, and a more stable version will be available soon. Thank you for your patience and understanding!

Stay tuned for updates! üîßüöÄ
